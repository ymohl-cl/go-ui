# game-builder
Game-builder is a game builder lite using [SDL2 veandco](https://github.com/veandco/go-sdl2).
It's not convention to compose a game, just proof of concept today.

The wrapper is implemented with goroutines.

I try to define a good architecture and simple of use.
Inspired by Unity 3D (without interface home machine).
I try to provide a good tool to creates models scenes / layout and objects.

I would be pleased to talk about that with you on mail:
